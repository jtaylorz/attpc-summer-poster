\small{Data-analysis software for the Active-Target Time Projection Chamber (AT-TPC) at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) was documented and used to analyze unbound states in Argon-40 ($^{40}$Ar). NSCL is a national user facility funded by the National Science Foundation that provides rare isotope beams to researchers around the world to study cutting-edge nuclear physics phenomena. Rare isotope beams are produced, accelerated, and delivered to various experimental setups, each with their own physics motivations. One such setup is the AT-TPC, a gas-filled detector that acts as both the detector and target for high-efficiency detection of low-intensity, exotic nuclear reactions. The pytpc framework is a Python package for analyzing AT-TPC data and was developed for the analysis of $^{46}$Ar(p, p) data. The existing software was used to analyze data produced by the $^{40}$Ar(p, p) experiment that ran in August, 2015. Usage of the package was documented in an analysis manual both to improve analysis steps and aid in the work of future AT-TPC users. Software features and analysis methods in the pytpc framework will be presented along with the $^{40}$Ar results.

{\small{KuPol is contributing to estimate the location for the high energy emission on these AGNs and to study potential spectral fluctuations that may arise during the flaring events. The uncertainty on the degree of correlation between different energies reduces when the data span for long periods and is rich in sampling, hence the rationale for this program and we therefore advocate for similar observing modes at other frequencies.}

\small{The KuPol instrument is a dual-beam receiver for the 40m telescope at OVRO. It is, in fact, a hybrid of two separate instruments called the analog and the digital instrument. The \textbf{Analog Instrument} is a dual-polarization, beam-differencing radiometer that is designed to produce identical data to the previous Ku-band, instrument that KuPol replaces. It is composed by the Cryostat, the Cold Plate, and UBE. The \textbf{Digital Instrument} is a digital spectropolarimeter that processes the band between 13 to 18 GHz in 500 MHz wide chunks with âˆ¼8 MHz resolution. In this instrument is performed the signal distribution, downconversion, digitization and processing, and data readout and archiving.}

{\small{The calibration is achieved by measuring the isolation parameter, $\alpha$, at different angles.}
\small{\textbf{Figure 2.} Plot comparing before/after $\alpha$ for 2016-01-18 Digital Model Calibration.\\
For the calibration procedure, we take spectra of quantities derived from voltages in each bin after the FFT with the noise diode on, and then with the noise diode off. We use this data to adjust for the varying gain and phase of the four RF chains, and hence calibrate the receiver output. The calibration procedure instrument is a three-step process, requiring three different firing of the noise diode, each with their own set of calculations.\\
\textbf{1. Gain Correction.} We calculate the gain correction for each RF channel. We assume that the noise diode injects a flat spectrum, and calculate the gain correction coefficients $B_{j}$ for $j=1...4$.}

\small{The Power Spectral Density (PSD) of a signal is the spectral decomposition of a signal into different frequency components, as a function of power at each frequency bin.\\
The PSD is usually estimated by means of an FFT, and it can be used to characterize the time variability of the blazar flux. The analysis requires regularity in the signal sampling, which is seldom the case. The PSD can also be estimated by a periodogram, which is the convolution between a window function and the signal. We are trying Blackman-Harris window function in order to minimize the spectral sidelobes introduced in the analysis.}

\small{\textbf{Figure 3.} The first and second plot correspond the sources of J1415+1320 and J1653+3945, respectively, observed by the OVRO program.}\\
The next step to determine the PSD, is to calculate the Fourier Transform of the window function and the curve separately and convolve, which is analogous to convolve the signal with the window function and apply Transform.

\headerbox{Conclusion and Future Work}{name=conclusion,column=1,below=receiver,span=2}
{\small{ With the PSD analysis and by looking for correlations in the variability, we hope to better understand the emission mechanisms at the hearts of Active Galactic Nuclei. The work is under development and we are in search of the best method to estimate the PSD. On the other hand we have presented and defined the KuPol calibration method. From this in the coming weeks we will obtain calibration results of the 40m receiver. }
